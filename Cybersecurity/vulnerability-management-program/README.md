# Vulnerability Management Program

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, from inception to completion.

_**Inception State:**_ the organization has no existing policy or vulnerability management practices in place.

_**Completion State:**_ a formal policy is enacted, stakeholder buy-in is secured, and a full cycle of organization-wide vulnerability remediation is successfully completed.

### Vulnerability Management Policy Draft Creation

This phase focuses on drafting a Vulnerability Management Policy as a starting point for stakeholder engagement. The initial draft outlines scope, responsibilities, and remediation timelines, and may be adjusted based on feedback from relevant departments to ensure practical implementation before final approval by upper management.  
[Draft Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pkLZZ6bxoIVbSRGFPu9UkGRJwWeajpwE/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=106209072733120910519&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Step 2) Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

In this phase, a meeting with the server team introduces the draft Vulnerability Management Policy and assesses their capability to meet remediation timelines. Feedback leads to adjustments, like extending the critical remediation window from 48 hours to one week, ensuring collaborative implementation.

### Conversation Between Jason and Jimmy

**Jason:** Hey, good morning, Jimmy. How’s everything been? I know everyone’s been busy these last few weeks.

**Jimmy:** Good morning, Jason. Yeah, it’s been a bit hectic, but we’re hanging in there. Thanks for asking. I had a chance to review the policy draft, and overall, it makes sense. However, with our current staffing levels, we won’t be able to meet the aggressive remediation timelines—especially the 48-hour window for critical vulnerabilities.

**Jason:** I totally understand. It is a bit aggressive, especially to start. Maybe we could extend the critical remediation window to one week as a compromise? We could still keep the 48-hour timeline for truly severe zero-day vulnerabilities.

**Jimmy:** That sounds reasonable. We appreciate the flexibility. Would it also be possible to have some leeway in the beginning while we adjust to the new remediation and patching process? Maybe just for the first few months?

**Jason:** Absolutely. Once the policy is finalized, we’ll officially launch the program, but we’re planning to give all departments about six months to fully adapt to the new process. Does that sound fair?

**Jimmy:** That works. We’ll do our best. I appreciate you including us in the decision-making process—it really helps us feel like we’re part of the solution.

**Jason:** Of course! We’re all in this together. Thanks for working with us.

**Jimmy:** No problem. And thanks for keeping this short—these are my favorite kinds of meetings.

**Jason:** Same here! See you later.

### Step 4) Mock Meeting: Initial Scan Permission (Server Team)

The team collaborates with the server team to initiate scheduled credential scans. A compromise is reached to scan a single server first, monitoring resource impact, and using just-in-time Active Directory credentials for secure, controlled access.  

## Conversation Between Jason and Jimmy

**0:01 Jason:** Hey, morning Jimmy. How's everything been recently? I know everyone's been busy these last few weeks.

**0:05 Jimmy:** Good morning, Jason. Yeah, it's been a bit hectic, but we're hanging in there. Thanks for asking. I had a chance to read through the policy draft, and overall, it makes sense. However, with our current staffing, we can't meet the aggressive remediation timelines—especially the 48-hour window for critical vulnerabilities.

**0:23 Jason:** Yeah, I totally understand. It is a bit aggressive, especially to start. Perhaps we can extend the critical close to one week—it might be a good compromise for now. Then we can reserve the 48-hour window for those truly severe zero-day vulnerabilities.

**0:38 Jimmy:** Yeah, that sounds reasonable. We appreciate the flexibility. Can we have a bit of leeway in the beginning as we work through getting used to the remediation and patching process? Just for the first few months or so?

**0:50 Jason:** Absolutely. After the policy is finalized, we'll officially start the program, but we're planning to give all the departments about six months to adjust and get comfortable with the new process. Does that sound fair?

**1:02 Jimmy:** Thanks, Jason. We'll do our best. I appreciate you including us in the decision-making process—it really helps us feel like we're part of the solution.

**1:11 Jason:** Yeah, of course! We're all in this together. Thanks for working with us.

**1:16 Jimmy:** No problem. Thanks for the short meeting.

**1:18 Jason:** Yeah, those are my favorite types. Bye now.

**1:21 Jimmy:** See you later.

### Step 5) Initial Scan of Server Team Assets

In this phase, an insecure Windows Server is provisioned to simulate the server team's environment. After creating vulnerabilities, an authenticated scan is performed, and the results are exported for future remediation steps.

### Step 6) Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

We assessed vulnerabilities and established a remediation prioritization strategy based on ease of remediation and impact. The following priorities were set:

1. Third Party Software Removal (Wireshark)
2. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Protocols & Ciphers)
3. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Guest Account Group Membership)
4. Windows OS Updates

---

### Step 7) Distributing Remediations to Remediation Teams

The server team received remediation scripts and scan reports to address key vulnerabilities. This streamlined their efforts and prepared them for a follow-up review.

### First Cycle Remediation Effort Summary

The remediation process reduced total vulnerabilities by 80%, from 30 to 6. Critical vulnerabilities were resolved by the second scan (100%), and high vulnerabilities dropped by 90%. Mediums were reduced by 76%. In an actual production environment, asset criticality would further guide future remediation efforts.

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the vulnerability management program transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase ensures that vulnerabilities continue to be managed proactively, keeping systems secure over time. Regular scans, continuous monitoring, and timely remediation are crucial components of this phase. (See [Finalized Policy] for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key activities in Maintenance Mode include:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans**: Perform regular scans (e.g., weekly or monthly) to detect new vulnerabilities as systems evolve.
- **Patch Management**: Continuously apply security patches and updates, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- **Remediation Follow-ups**: Address newly identified vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing based on risk and impact.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Periodically review the Vulnerability Management Policy to ensure it aligns with the latest security best practices and organizational needs.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with the vulnerability management policy and external regulations.
- **Ongoing Communication with Stakeholders**: Maintain open communication with teams responsible for remediation, ensuring efficient coordination.

By maintaining an active vulnerability management process, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure long-term security resilience.
